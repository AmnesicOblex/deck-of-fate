While you toss and turn you fall into another vivid dream. You find yourself in a dark and cool burrow, surrounded by dirt. Your body feels unfamiliar, but not unlike one you've stepped into before. You have round floppy ears, fluffy gray fur, small paws, and a hairy tail. You scurry out from your hole weaving through the bushes. You know you need to be wary of the birds in the garden and the cats in the street so you move carefully, pausing to sniff the air with your soft nose and listen for any unfamiliar sounds. Your thoughts are scattered and take the form of scents, sounds, and occasionally pictures instead of any concrete words or concepts. 
	The colony needs a new home, the dark ones have started sneaking in at night and devouring our young. You are a young scout, one of many tasked with finding the most suitable site for a new burrow. You scurry into the structure left behind by the two legs, leaving the safety of the shadows of the pine in the garden. A thin layer of dust covers the wooden floor and you can smell rotten fruit and cheese in the cupboard. The building doesn't look very promising, but something is drawing you here. Not quite a smell, but a sense nonetheless. 
	You follow your instincts down into a dank wine cellar. You weave through wine bottles and hollow casks to find an entrance into the walls. Inside you find a network of crawlspaces connecting this apartment with others above and beside. This seems like a promising site for a new burrow, but instead of returning to the colony you keep exploring. You scurry through the tunnels, weaving through vents and pipes. Soon you find yourself completely and utterly lost. When you awake you find yourself worrying about the poor lost mouse.
