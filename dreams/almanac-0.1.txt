You see vivid flashes of a vision while you sleep. You see a group of young, drunk nobles exploring the ruins of a great building. In a small antechamber you can see a young nobleman in unfamiliar garb <History>. The man would be considered classically attractive if not for his baby fat around his neck and a gut distended from drink. He and another attractive noblewoman in dress with a plunging neckline hide in the shadows, caught in a passionate embrace. Their throes of passion are interrupted by the sound of falling rock and collapsing walls. You feel the rocks and dirt pressing on your chest and dust filling your lungs. You awake, tangled in sheets, covered in sweat and gasping for breath.
