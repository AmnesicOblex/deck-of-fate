You see vivid flashes of a vision while you sleep. You see a great city, the buildings a hewn from dark obsidian and the architecture is square and unfamiliar <History Check>. In one of the blocky buildings you see a classroom full of skinny young students with shaved heads. At the front of the classroom there is a tall stern looking teacher writing on a blackboard in an unfamiliar script <History Check>. One of the students is making fun of the teacher behind his back. The teacher whips around catching the young boy in the act. The strict teacher makes the student come in front of the class and he takes out a yardstick. The boy bares his wrist and the teacher begins striking his wrist leaving red, angry welts. You see the teachers dark gray eyes staring at the child's bright gold eyes with dark circles under his eyes. The teacher gives a triumphant smirk when the yardstick draws blood and he lets go of the boys arm. The boy licks the blood from his wrist and grins maniacally at the Teacher. When you jolt awake in a cold sweat, the child's gold eyes and his mocking grin are burned into your mind.
