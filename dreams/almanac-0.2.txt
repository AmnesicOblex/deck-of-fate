You see vivid flashes of a vision while you sleep. You see a young tabaxi street urchin in a crowded, dusty market <History>. You can feel the young tabaxi's hunger in your gut as she looks at a fishmongers stall with a hungry look in her eyes. You feel your mouth watering and you see the tabaxi lick her chops. She strikes quickly and slides two mackerels into her waiting pouch while the fisherman is flirting with a young noblewoman. She blends in with the crowd for a moment, before she hears "stop thief!" She breaks into a sprint. Despite her young age, her feline form outpaces the human guards. You feel your heart race and your muscles burn as she stumbles to a halt, out of breath. Hungrily she takes the fish out of her bag and begins to devour the fish raw. Preoccupied with her breakfast, the first meal she has had in days, she bumps into a city guard. Before she knows what is happening the guard has her hand in his iron grip. "Think you can steal from our market you filthy Malkin <History>? You know the price you'll have to pay." With a quick flash of a blade and a spurt of blood the guard chops off the young tabaxi's pinky finger.  You awake, pillow wet with drool, clutching your aching finger while your belly grumbles for breakfast.
