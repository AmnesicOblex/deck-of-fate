# The Deck of Fate

_Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)_

**_Disclaimer: This magical artifact/patron is super homebrewed so it may be unbalanced. If necessary nerfs and/or buffs will be implemented to try to balance it._**

**The Deck of Fate** is a deck of 56 cards that appear to make up the low deck or _minor arcana_ of a traditional tarot deck. Tarot cards are pagan fortune telling devices native to Centerra. The high deck or _major arcana_ is made up another 22 cards which appear to be missing from this set. The cards are old and worn. The paper is thin and stiff. The art is faded and the embossed card backs are cracked. Additionally the faces of 6 cards have been blackened and burnt beyond recognition. You can tell by the process of elimination that the missing cards are as follows:

- The 9 of Cups
- The Page of Cups
- The King of Cups
- The King of Wands
- The Knight of Swords
- The King of Swords

## Features

**The Deck** is damaged and divided and subsequently has only a fraction of the power it once had. As your bond with the Deck grows and you make any repairs or restorations you may unlock additional features.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use **The Deck** as a spellcasting focus as long as you have one hand free to interact with **The Deck**.

## Fate Die

Some effects of **The Deck** will require you to roll a **Fate Die**. This starts off as a d4, but it will grow over time.

## Twist of Fate

Reading the tarot cards gives you glimpses into the future. When you finish a long rest, you can take a peak at the top three cards of the deck. If a Minor Arcana card is inverted, you can choose to take 1 fate die of psychic damage to revert the card to its normal orientation. If a Major Arcana card is inverted, you can choose to roll 1 fate die to see how many fate dice of damage you must take in order to revert the card to its normal orientation.

## Tempt Fate

When you hit an enemy with eldritch blast you can choose to **Tempt Fate** and draw a card from **The Deck of Fate** as a bonus action. The drawn card will modify the effects of the spell. Fate can be a cruel mistress so these effects may hurt you as often as they help you. If you ever draw a black card you will take 1 fate die of psychic damage. Any effects with durations will usually last for 1 fate die rounds or in some cases 1 fate die hours.

## Cheat Fate

Once per long rest after drawing a card from the Deck you can choose to draw a second card. After learning the effects of both cards you may choose which effect takes place. If you ever draw two black cards they both take effect.

## Potential Future Features

### The Debt Always Comes Due

Every time you cheat fate the effect goes into a buffer. The next time you are critically hit with an attack the effects occur.

### Pocket Aces

At the end of a long rest you can draw three cards from the Deck and pick one to use when tempting fate or something.
